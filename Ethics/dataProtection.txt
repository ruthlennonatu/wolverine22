After researching data protection on dataprotection.ie I had found the main points on how to store and process data legally and safely. 

Lawfulness, fairness, and transparency: Any processing of personal data should be lawful and fair. It should be transparent to individuals that personal data concerning them are collected,
used, consulted, or otherwise processed and to what extent the personal data are or will be processed.

Purpose Limitation: Personal data should only be collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes. 
In particular, the specific purposes for which personal data are processed should be explicit and legitimate and determined at the time of the collection of the personal data.

Data Minimisation: Processing of personal data must be adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed. 
Personal data should be processed only if the purpose of the processing could not reasonably be fulfilled by other means.

Accuracy: Controllers must ensure that personal data are accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; taking every reasonable step to ensure that personal data that are inaccurate, 
having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay.

Storage Limitation: Personal data should only be kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for as long as is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed.

Accountability: Finally, the controller is responsible for, and must be able to demonstrate, their compliance with all of the above-named Principles of Data Protection. Controllers must take responsibility

# RESTful API

It is best to integrate these API calls into a CI/CD pipeline for fully automated building and deployment.

To fully automate the building, testing and deployment of modern applications, RESTful API calls are essential for information transfer between services. 

RESTful API applications rely heavily on HTTP requests to external services to GET, POST, PUT and DELETE data. 

This information transfer is done with RESTful or REST APIs to reduce the bandwidth associated with traditional APIs. 

REST APIs are essential for distributed computing and cloud-based technologies. 

One example is publishing packages to a deployment bucket using the  REST API. 

Another is using cURL to download a package from the web to be installed.

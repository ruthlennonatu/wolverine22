In order to maintain compliance with the gdpr guidelines they first had to be understood, this was illustrated in a previously completed issue 
labeled number #103, which detailed the importance of gdpr guidelines along with information on what the standard should be and how it should 
be maintained at that level. 


Now that there is ample information on best practices to avoid any malpractice in this area. This information will be given to all software developers 
on this project, this will be done at a meeting that will educate all members on how they should conduct their development.

A checklist for gdpr guideline compliance will be sent to all members so they can check without any uncertainty that they are sticking to all aspects.

"The term ‘personal data’ is the entryway to the application of the General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR). Only if a processing of data concerns personal data, the General Data 
Protection Regulation applies. The term is defined in Art. 4 (1). Personal data are any 
information which are related to an identified or identifiable natural person." 
This is a direct quote from the gdpr guidelines. The laws are clearly defined on paper so

DevOps Pipeline
A pipeline in software engineering team is a set of automated processes which allows DevOps professionals and developer to reliably and efficiently compile, build, and deploy their code to their production compute platforms.

The most common components of a pipeline in DevOps are build automation or continuous integration, test automation, and deployment automation.

Components of a DevOps Pipeline
The DevOps pipeline is composed of seven components:

Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery: These two components are typically mentioned together, usually referred to as CI/CD or a CI/CD pipeline. Continuous integration means the system frequently integrates new code changes into the central repository, usually a few times per day. This process makes it easier to merge different code changes and spot bugs.
The continuous delivery aspect means incremental deliveries of software and updates to production. CD helps developers automate the whole software release operation and increase how frequently they release new features.

Continuous Testing: DevOps personnel use continuous testing to perform automated tests on any code integrations accumulated during the continuous integration (CI) phase. CI ensures high-quality app development and evaluates the release's risks before sending it to delivery.

Continuous Deployment: This component is often blurred with continuous delivery, although both are very different parts of the process. Continuous deployment follows continuous delivery. Any updates that successfully make it through the automated testing phase get automatically released into production. This way, continuous deployment allows multiple production deployments on a given day.

Continuous Monitoring: Continuous monitoring validates the environment’s stability and verifies that the applications are doing what they’re designed to do. In addition, the operations teams monitor the applications and systems, keeping an eye on the latter's performance.

Continuous Feedback: Continuous feedback is often overlooked, which is regrettable because DevOps teams need constant feedback to ensure that the app does what everyone (the developers, stakeholders, and customers) expect it to. Everyone needs to be on the same page, and that’s what continuous feedback does.

Continuous Operations. This component does exactly what the name implies: maintaining a 24-hour, seven-day-a-week operation with little to no planned downtime. The ultimate goal of continuous operations is to ensure that end-users won't suffer interruptions due to any hardware or software changes. It's an expensive initial investment but pays for itself in the long run because it prevents costly production losses.
